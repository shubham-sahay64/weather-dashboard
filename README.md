# 🌤️ My Weather App

This is a weather app. You can type a city name and see the weather. It shows temperature, wind, humidity, and if it’s sunny or rainy. You can also see the weather for next days.

## 🧰 What I Used

- React (to make the app work)
- Tailwind CSS (to make it look nice)
- Axios (to get the weather)
- Framer Motion (for little animations)
- Netlify (to put it on the internet)
